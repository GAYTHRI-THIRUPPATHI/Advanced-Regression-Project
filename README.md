## PROJECT NAME

### ADVANCED REGRESSION TO PREDICT SALE PRICE OF A HOUSE

__Aim__ : To build a __regression model with regularisation__ to predict the __actual prices of house__, given the dataset of previous sale of houses in Australia.  <br>

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
<br>A __US-based housing company__ named __Surprise Housing__ has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses __data analytics__ to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.<br><br>
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy, to enter the market. A __regression model with regularisation__ is required in order to __predict the actual value of the prospective properties__ and decide whether to invest in them or not.<br><br>
The company wants to know:

> - __Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house?__<br>
> - __How well those variables describe the price of a house?__<br>

### BUSINESS GOAL : 
We should build a model to predict the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand __how exactly the prices vary with the variables__. They can accordingly manipulate the __strategy of the firm__ and concentrate on areas that will __yield high returns__. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the __pricing dynamics__ of a new market.
